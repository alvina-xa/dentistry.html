        <h2>Private practice</h2>
        <img src="img/7.jpg" width="300"/>
        
            <p> In Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, dentists in private practice constitute the vast majority of all licensed dentists. The situation is much the same in France and various other countries.</p>
            <p>  Dental practice has changed significantly since the 1920s, without a concurrent change in the basic dental curriculum. Dental procedures have shifted from the repair and extraction of teeth for the relief of pain to the prevention of disease. Dental practice has also changed in larger urban centres from the isolated private practice common in the early decades of the 20th century to a complex system of groups of professionals in a central location. Extensive use is made of dental hygienists, who often receive the patient from the examining dentist. Dental hygienists provide services such as performing preventive procedures, scaling, taking X-rays, and teaching dental health strategies. Most practices also use dental assistants.</p>
            <p>  Another development that has occurred in dental health care services is the extension of the duties currently carried out by dental auxiliaries. New Zealand has pioneered in the field with the creation of the dental nurse, an auxiliary who is trained to provide dental care for children without the supervision of a dentist. The United Kingdom has also developed the dental auxiliary, who performs somewhat similar duties but under closer supervision. In Canada and the United States, pilot projects have been conducted to test the feasibility of using dental auxiliaries for certain operative procedures in order to increase productivity, quality, and general service to the public.</p>
            <p>France may be taken as an example of the development of the practice of dentistry in continental Europe. There are two types of dentists practicing in France, the chirurgien dentiste  (“dental surgeon”) and the stomatologist. The practice of dentistry in France by a chirurgien dentiste has since 1892 been restricted to persons of French nationality who hold a state diploma and who are registered with the Order of Dentists. The Order of Dentists is responsible for registration and discipline but is not concerned with dental education, which is controlled by the state through the common state diploma.</p>
       <p> Stomatologists are practitioners who have a diploma in medicine and either a diploma in dental surgery or a certificate of special studies (two years) in stomatology (see below Other disciplines). Specialization within the field of dentistry is not encouraged. There are no rules laid down for it, nor are there any special courses or diplomas or titles.</p>
        
       
        <h2>  Hospital dental practice</h2>
        <img src="img/9.jpg" width="300"/>
        <p>  Three types of dental care are normally carried out in the hospital  environment: (1) clinical procedures normally provided in a dental office, for ambulatory inpatients and outpatients, (2) bedside care for persons admitted for other medical reasons, and (3) inpatient care for patients admitted to a hospital for purely dental conditions.</p>
        <p> Dentists may treat patients in hospitals either privately, on a fee-for-service basis, or under some form of government program, such as the National Health Service in the United Kingdom or the Provincial Medicare Plan (surgery only) in Canada. Hospital dental services have for years been an integral part of dental health care and dental education in the United Kingdom, and such services by hospital dental departments have expanded steadily in the United States and Canada.</p>
        <p> Hospital dental departments are normally established in the same manner as any other hospital department and are headed by a chief of service, who has the same status as other chiefs of service within the hospital. In some instances the chief of the dental department may be responsible to the chief of surgery. There are two types of hospital dental departments—one that is established in a teaching hospital and the other that is in a general hospital with no teaching component. In the teaching hospital the dental department is associated with a faculty of dentistry and forms an integral part of the undergraduate curriculum and, if they exist, of the graduate and postgraduate programs. One of the chief purposes of hospital dental departments is to make available the service of consultants to other hospital departments and general practitioners. This service is most highly developed in teaching hospitals. Usually, certain general dental treatment is provided for inpatients and outpatients. Hospital dental services or departments are prevalent in western Europe.</p>
        
        <h2> Public health practice</h2>
        <p> Generally typical of dental public health practice in Canada and in many areas of the United States is the program in Ontario. There, dentists trained in public health, hygienists, and dental assistants carry out a preventive and educational program basically concerned with the examination of children, the recording of basic dental conditions, and the provision of dental health education.</p>
        
        <h2>Military practice</h2>
        <p>Most countries of the world provide dental care for their armed services. In Canada the Canadian Forces Dental Service, with a brigadier general as director, has the same status as the Canadian Forces Health Service. In the United States, each branch of the military has its own dental corps, each on a par with the various medical corps. There are an Army Dental Corps, a Navy Dental Corps (which serves personnel of the Marine Corps as well as the Navy), an Air Force Dental Corps, and a Coast Guard Dental Corps. Each of these corps is headed by an officer of the rank of brigadier general or rear admiral. In wartime the Public Health Service provides dental service to personnel of the merchant marine.
        </p>
      
        <h2>Governmental practice</h2>
        
        <p> In many countries dentists are required to work a number of years for the government before they may be considered private practitioners of the type known in Canada and the United States. This service requirement may be based on the fulfillment of an obligation for government financial support during undergraduate training, or there may be a government regulation that all dental graduates must work for the state for a prescribed number of years. Another example of government practice is in the United Kingdom, where dentists are employed by local authorities to provide dental care under the Maternal and Child Welfare Services and the School Dental Service.</p>
        <p>The employment of dentists on a salary basis for the general practice  of dentistry is not extensive in the United States or Canada. At the national level it may be the provision of dental care for eligible Native Americans and Eskimos, war veterans, or inmates of penitentiaries. At a municipal level dentists may be employed in a school dental service. Dentists in both Canada and the United States commonly agree to provide service for families who qualify for social assistance. They are paid on a fee-for-service basis; the fee schedule is usually set, normally after consultation with the dentist, by the agency responsible for the social service plan.</p>
        <p> Government medical care was introduced in Japan in the late 1930s. This system was expanded until by 1962 almost the entire population was covered. There are limitations to the services offered by government medical care, as in orthodontics or in preventive dentistry.</p>
