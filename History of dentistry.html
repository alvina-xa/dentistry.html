        <h2>Early dentistry</h2>
        <img src="img/9.jpg" width="300"/>
      <p>  
        Dentistry, in some form, has been practiced since ancient times. For example, Egyptian skulls dating from 2900 to 2750 BCE contain evidence of small holes in the jaw in the vicinity of a tooth’s roots. Such holes are believed to have been drilled to drain abscesses. In addition, accounts of dental treatment appear in Egyptian scrolls dating from 1500 BCE. It is thought that the Egyptians practiced oral surgery perhaps as early as 2500 BCE, although evidence for this is minimal. An early attempt at tooth replacement dates to Phoenicia (modern Lebanon) around 600 BCE, where missing teeth were replaced with animal teeth and were bound into place with cord.</p>
       
        <p>True restorative dentistry began with the Etruscans, who lived in the area of what is today central and northern Italy. Numerous dental bridges and partial dentures of gold have been found in Etruscan tombs, which date to about 500 BCE. The Romans, who conquered the Etruscans, adopted Etruscan culture, and dentistry became a regular part of Roman medical practice. The Greeks also practiced some form of oral medicine, including tooth extractions, from the time of Hippocrates, around 400 BCE.</p>
          
         <p>  In the Eastern world, dentistry had a totally different history. There is evidence that the early Chinese practiced some restorative dentistry as early as the year 200 BCE, using silver amalgam as fillings. Oral medicine was part of the regular medical practice in other early Asian civilizations, such as those in India and Japan.</p> 
         
         
        <h2>Advances in dentistry in the 20th century</h2>
        <img src="img/3.jpg" width="300"/>
          <p>In 20th-century America, advances occurred in all aspects of dentistry. Frederick McKay, a young American dentist practicing in Colorado, observed a condition of mottling of his patients’ teeth, in which there was an almost total absence of decay. Following years of research, McKay and others were able to show that this was due to the presence in the drinking water of high amounts of naturally occurring fluoride, which protects teeth against decay. As a result, public health officials established measures to add fluoride to public water supplies in communities around the United States. Since fluoridation was initiated in 1945, dental caries in children have decreased by more than 50 percent.</p> 
          
          
          <p>In 1896 American dentist Charles Edmund Kells introduced X-ray technology in dentistry and thereby ushered in an era of accurate diagnosis of dental ailments. In addition, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, American dental pathologist Greene Vardiman Black (sometimes called the father of modern dentistry, although this title is shared with Fauchard) standardized the instruments and restorative materials used by dentists. In 1903 American dentist Charles Land introduced the use of porcelain in crowns, which led to a new era of aesthetic dentistry. In 1907 American dentist William Taggart introduced a precision casting machine that allowed dentists to create gold restorations of great accuracy with a minimum of tooth removal. In 1913 American dentist Edwin J. Greenfield demonstrated the first modern and truly functional dental implant, paving the way for today’s highly successful implant dentistry. The introduction in 1953 of the first commercially successful water-driven turbine drill, developed by American dentist Robert Nelson, led the way to the high-speed dental drill. The Borden air-turbine drill, introduced in 1957 and today used universally, reaches speeds of up to 400,000 revolutions per minute and allows for greater accuracy and control by the dentist and greater comfort of the patient.</p>
        
          <p>
            Numerous research projects into dental diseases and their treatment are carried out at the U.S. National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research in Bethesda, Md., a component of the National Institutes of Health. The work done at such institutes promises a future in which new materials and new methods of treatment greatly diminish oral and dental disease.
